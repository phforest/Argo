[1mDESCRIPTION
[0m    Every app can have both a short and long description. Whereas the short
    description should give the most basic information, this section can go into
    more detail. In fact, I'm just rambling here to get some line wrapping
    action going.

    The options are as follows:

    [1m--bar[0m                                                           [1 argument]
        A relatively short description. Especially compared to --foo

    [1m--foo[0m                                                 [required][1 argument]
        This is a long description for the option foo which really only serves
        the purpose to have enough content so that we need multiple lines in the
        help output. I guess this is enough now.

    [1m--help (-h)[0m                                                   [no arguments]
        Prints out the help.

    [1m--version (-v)[0m                                                [no arguments]
        Prints out the version information.
